# Butcher

A **very quickly put together** python script for killing network hogs. 

### Features
- Disables windows update (restart to fix)
- Monitors processes and prompts the user whether or not to kill a task that is using bandwidth 
- The script remembers your choices for killing tasks


### Warning
No testing was done and there are no safety features are implemented

### Motive
Starting a game through steam appears to prompt every updater on windows to run and continue to restart themselves when closed. Butcher watches your processes to kill bandwidth hogs during gaming sessions.
